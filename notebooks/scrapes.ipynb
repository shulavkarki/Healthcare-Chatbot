       "   'What is AA amyloidosis?': 'AA amyloidosis is one type of the rare disorder amyloidosis (pronounced “am-uh-loy-doh-sis”). Amyloidosis happens when proteins in your body lose their three-dimensional (3D) structure and become twisted clumps of misshapen fibrils (amyloid deposits) that gather on your organs and tissues.\\n\\nAA amyloidosis is also known as secondary amyloidosis or amyloid serum A protein. This amyloidosis type happens when you have high levels of inflammation in your body that boost the serum A protein levels in your bloodstream. You may have high serum A protein levels if you have a long-lasting infection or inflammatory disease. In a sense, AA amyloidosis is a serious complication of inflammatory diseases and conditions. Healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis by controlling the underlying disease or condition.'},\n",

       "   'What causes AA amyloidosis?': 'AA amyloidosis is a type of amyloidosis. Healthcare providers call amyloidosis a “protein misfolding disorder.” Your proteins are long molecules that form 3D structures. They’re multitaskers that do everything from providing energy, balancing fluids and helping with immunity to providing structure, carrying material and regulating your body’s processes.\\n\\nNormally, proteins leave your bloodstream once they finish their assigned tasks. In protein misfolding disorders, proteins take on abnormal shapes that can’t be removed and your body can’t use. In AA amyloidosis, the abnormal proteins clump together, making amyloid deposits or fibrils that collect in your organs.\\n\\nRecent studies have identified dozens of medical conditions that cause AA amyloidosis. Those conditions include certain blood cancers, bacterial infections from diseases like chronic ulcers to rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, or inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. People may inherit conditions that cause AA amyloidosis, including periodic fever syndromes such as Familial Mediterranean Fever.'},\n",

       "   'How do healthcare providers diagnose AA amyloidosis?': 'Healthcare providers may do a series of biopsies to diagnose AA amyloidosis:\\n\\nProviders may do other tests to rule out AL amyloidosis, which is another amyloidosis type. AL amyloidosis and AA amyloidosis have similar symptoms, but AL amyloidosis is a more aggressive form of amyloidosis.'},\n",

       "   'How do healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis?': 'AA amyloidosis happens because you have a chronic inflammatory condition that caused abnormal proteins to gather in clumps on your organs. Healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis by treating the underlying inflammatory condition. By treating the underlying condition, providers reduce the inflammation that caused AA amyloidosis. AA amyloidosis symptoms ease as inflammation levels drop.\\n\\nThey may also use medications that treat active AA amyloidosis. Providers and researchers are developing additional AA amyloidosis treatments that may clear amyloid fibrils from your bloodstream before the fibril can build on your organs. They’re also developing lab-made antibodies to target and clear amyloid fibrils already lodged in organs.'},\n",

Researchers have identified dozens of diseases and conditions that cause long-lasting inflammation linked to AA amyloidosis. Ask your healthcare provider to explain how your condition caused AA amyloidosis and how they’ll treat your inflammatory condition.\\n\\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\\n\\nIn a sense, AA amyloidosis is a very rare and serious complication to dozens of common inflammatory diseases or conditions. Fortunately, healthcare providers can treat AA amyloidosis by treating the underlying condition. Many times, AA amyloidosis symptoms may seem like common problems you’re used to managing as part of your specific inflammatory disease or condition. But like many serious illnesses, healthcare providers can do more to treat AA amyloidosis when they catch the condition in its early stages. Talk to your provider if you notice changes in your inflammatory disease or condition. They’ll be glad to evaluate your symptoms and explain what they mean.'}},\n",

      "About 1 in 4 people have no symptoms of babesiosis. Unlike other tick-borne diseases, it usually doesn’t cause a rash.\n",

      "\n",
      "Weight loss isn’t a common sign of babesiosis. But if you don’t feel like eating or are feeling sick to your stomach and vomiting, you might lose weight.\n",
      "What causes babesiosis?\n",
      "Several types of Babesia parasites cause babesiosis. Babesia are protozoa, one-celled organisms that are too small to see without a microscope. They get into your blood through a tick bite. There, they infect and destroy your red blood cells. In mild cases, this can make you tired. In severe cases, like if you have a compromised immune system, the infection can cause life-threatening complications.\n",

      "B. microti is the most common cause of symptomatic babesiosis in the U.S. Other Babesia species that sometimes make you sick include B. duncani, B. divergens, B. venatorum and B. crassa.\n",
      "How do you get babesiosis?\n",
      "Babesiosis spreads from animals to humans when a tick bites an infected animal — usually a small rodent, like a mouse — and then bites you. The parasite infects your blood cells and reproduces there.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the U.S., the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the most common carrier of the parasite that causes babesiosis. Blacklegged ticks carry many other illnesses, including Lyme disease and anaplasmosis. It’s often called a “deer tick,” though deer usually don’t carry babesiosis. In Europe, castor bean ticks (I. ricinus) transmit Babesia.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also get babesiosis from a blood transfusion. This happens when a blood donor is infected without knowing it.\n",

      "No, babesiosis isn’t contagious from person to person. Rarely, Babesia is transmitted from a pregnant person to the fetus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Babesiosis is most common in the spring and summer. This is because young ticks (nymphs) come out in the spring and are more likely to spread Babesia than adult ticks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nymphs are small (about the size of a poppy seed) and can be hard to see. They grow into adults during the summer. You can still get babesiosis from an adult tick, but they’re easier to see, and you’re more likely to remove them before they bite you.\n",

      "How is babesiosis diagnosed?\n",
      "Blood tests diagnose babesiosis. Your healthcare provider will give you a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and health history. Let them know if you’ve recently (within the past three weeks) been in an area where you could’ve been bitten by a tick, even if you don’t remember being bitten. It’s also important for them to know if you’ve had a blood transfusion in the past six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your provider thinks you could have babesiosis, they’ll order tests to look for parasites in your blood. They’ll also rule out other illnesses that can cause similar symptoms.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24809-babesiosis#management-and-treatment\n",
      "How is babesiosis treated?\n",
      "Your provider can treat babesiosis with a combination of medications. These include antiprotozoals, antibiotics and antimalarial drugs. They might give them to you through an IV in your arm or in pill or liquid form for you to swallow.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "If you have a healthy immune system, babesiosis can last one to two weeks. If your provider treats you with medication, you might start to feel better in a day or two. If you have a weakened immune system, babesiosis can last a long time — months or years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, babesiosis symptoms can get better but come back later (relapse). If this happens, your provider will have to treat you again. You’re most at risk for relapse if you have a weakened immune system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after your other symptoms have gone away, you may still feel tired for several months. You should recover fully once your red blood cell counts return to normal. Ask your provider how long it might take to feel better.\n",

      "Most people with babesiosis make a full recovery. But babesiosis is fatal in about 1 in 10 people who are hospitalized for it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Baby acne can appear suddenly or develop slowly. Pimples can start as small, discolored dots on their skin before they turn into raised pimples. When the inflammation of the pimples reduces, so does their size. The pimples are temporary and usually go away within a few days to a couple of weeks. After the pimples go away, your baby’s skin will be blemish-free.\n",
      "What causes baby acne?\n",
      "The exact cause of baby acne is unknown. Acne is usually the result of clogged pores. When your pores clog, a pimple can develop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Providers suspect that baby acne is the result of hormonal changes that affect your newborn during birth or the first few weeks of their life. Hormones in the placenta can affect how your baby’s skin produces sebum. Sebum is an oily substance that the sebaceous glands in your baby’s skin make to protect their skin and hair. Too much sebum can clog pores and lead to acne.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, babies have sensitive skin when they’re born. Their skin may react negatively to anything that’s left on it for too long, especially if they have food, vomit or drool residue on their skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s possible that hormones from a birthing parent’s breast milk (chest milk) can affect your baby’s hormones, which can lead to acne. Baby acne is a temporary skin condition that clears up, most often without any medical treatment. This shouldn’t affect the way that you feed your newborn. Baby acne will go away as your newborn grows and their body adjusts to their new environment. If you have questions about how your breast milk (chest milk) affects your newborn’s skin, talk to your healthcare provider.\n",

      "What is E. coli?\n",
      "Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a group of bacteria that normally lives in the gut (gastrointestinal/GI tract) of healthy people and animals. The type that lives in your GI tract usually doesn’t hurt you — it even helps you digest your food. But under certain circumstances, many strains (types) of E. coli can make you sick. Many of the strains that cause infection can adhere (stick) to your cells and release toxins.\n",
      "What is an E. coli infection?\n",
      "An E. coli infection is any illness you get from strains of E. coli bacteria. For instance, there are harmful strains of E. coli that cause watery diarrhea, stomach pain and other digestive symptoms (gastroenteritis) if you accidentally ingest them. These are sometimes called diarrheagenic E. coli, and they’re often what people mean when they talk about E. coli infections. But the E. coli that usually live in your gut can also get in places they’re not supposed to be (like your urinary tract). This causes an E. coli infection there.\n",

      "You usually develop symptoms of an STEC infection within three to five days after drinking or eating foods contaminated with this E. coli bacteria. Other strains can make you sick within hours. Sometimes, symptoms start up to 10 days after exposure.\n",
      "What causes E. coli infections?\n",
      "Many strains of E. coli can cause diarrheagenic infections in your GI tract. Most cause similar symptoms, like watery diarrhea, but some are more serious than others. Scientists categorize them by how they attach to your cells and the types of toxins they release.\n",

      "STEC is a strain of E. coli that releases a toxin (Shiga toxin) that damages your cells. These are the same toxins released by Shigella bacteria. STEC is known for causing severe outbreaks of E. coli (where many people get sick), often from contaminated food.\n",
      "\n",
      "STEC is also called enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) because it can lead to bleeding in your intestines, causing bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic colitis). About 5% to 10% of people with STEC develop hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition that causes blood clots and damages your kidneys. The subtype E. coli O157:H7 is the most likely to cause severe illness.\n",

But you should always check with a provider if you have severe or long-lasting diarrhea, abdominal pain, pain when you pee, or are peeing very little.\n",
      "Can you die from E. coli?\n",
      "Yes, E. coli infections can be deadly. Studies suggest the mortality (death) rate for E. coli infections is around 17%. But the results of these studies vary widely (from 8% to 35%). In general, E. coli UTIs are less likely to be fatal than other kinds of E. coli infections.\n",

      "What causes ear barotrauma?\n",
      "Ear barotrauma happens when air or water pressure suddenly changes, putting pressure on your eustachian tubes. Your eustachian tubes run from the back of your middle ear to the back of your throat. The tubes help maintain equal air pressure on both sides of your eardrum by letting outside air into your middle ear.\n",

You can get it through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks or from an organ transplant.\\n\\nBabesiosis usually causes flu-like symptoms. But the parasite’s destruction of red blood cells can lead to life-threatening complications, especially if you have a weakened immune system. A common complication is hemolytic anemia, a condition where your red blood cells are destroyed faster than you can make new ones.\\n\\nYou can get babesiosis in places where Babesia parasites and the ticks that carry them are found together. These areas are in the U.S., Europe and Asia. In the U.S., it’s mostly found in the Upper Midwest and Northeast, with a few cases on the West Coast. It’s most common in seven states:\\n\\nBabesiosis is rare, with fewer than 3,000 cases reported in the U.S. each year.

It usually only lasts a few days to a couple of weeks.\\n\\nOther names for baby acne are newborn acne, neonatal acne or neonatal cephalic pustulosis.\\n\\nWhile both conditions have the same symptoms, the difference between baby acne and infantile acne is when it affects your child. Baby acne occurs on average around 2 weeks of age. Some babies are born with acne and it goes away within weeks. Infantile acne occurs between 2 months to 1 year. Symptoms of infantile acne can reach beyond pustules and bumps to include blackheads. If your child gets acne after 2 months of age, visit a healthcare provider.

      "What is AA amyloidosis?\n",
      "AA amyloidosis is one type of the rare disorder amyloidosis (pronounced “am-uh-loy-doh-sis”). Amyloidosis happens when proteins in your body lose their three-dimensional (3D) structure and become twisted clumps of misshapen fibrils (amyloid deposits) that gather on your organs and tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "AA amyloidosis is also known as secondary amyloidosis or amyloid serum A protein. This amyloidosis type happens when you have high levels of inflammation in your body that boost the serum A protein levels in your bloodstream. You may have high serum A protein levels if you have a long-lasting infection or inflammatory disease. In a sense, AA amyloidosis is a serious complication of inflammatory diseases and conditions. Healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis by controlling the underlying disease or condition.\n",
      "How does AA amyloidosis affect my body?\n",
      "AA amyloidosis can damage several of your organs, including your kidneys (most common), liver, spleen, stomach and intestines. Rarely, AA amyloidosis damages your heart. AA amyloidosis may also affect the amount of protein in your pee and your cholesterol levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "AA amyloidosis can be a terminal illness if it isn’t treated. You may develop AA amyloidosis if you have a chronic illness that causes inflammation. When healthcare providers treat the underlying condition, they’re also treating AA amyloidosis.\n",
      "Who is affected by AA amyloidosis?\n",
      "Anyone who has a chronic inflammatory condition can develop AA amyloidosis.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17854-amyloidosis-aa#symptoms-and-causes\n",
      "What causes AA amyloidosis?\n",
      "AA amyloidosis is a type of amyloidosis. Healthcare providers call amyloidosis a “protein misfolding disorder.” Your proteins are long molecules that form 3D structures. They’re multitaskers that do everything from providing energy, balancing fluids and helping with immunity to providing structure, carrying material and regulating your body’s processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally, proteins leave your bloodstream once they finish their assigned tasks. In protein misfolding disorders, proteins take on abnormal shapes that can’t be removed and your body can’t use. In AA amyloidosis, the abnormal proteins clump together, making amyloid deposits or fibrils that collect in your organs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies have identified dozens of medical conditions that cause AA amyloidosis. Those conditions include certain blood cancers, bacterial infections from diseases like chronic ulcers to rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, or inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. People may inherit conditions that cause AA amyloidosis, including periodic fever syndromes such as Familial Mediterranean Fever.\n",

      "How do healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis?\n",
      "AA amyloidosis happens because you have a chronic inflammatory condition that caused abnormal proteins to gather in clumps on your organs. Healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis by treating the underlying inflammatory condition. By treating the underlying condition, providers reduce the inflammation that caused AA amyloidosis. AA amyloidosis symptoms ease as inflammation levels drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "They may also use medications that treat active AA amyloidosis. Providers and researchers are developing additional AA amyloidosis treatments that may clear amyloid fibrils from your bloodstream before the fibril can build on your organs. They’re also developing lab-made antibodies to target and clear amyloid fibrils already lodged in organs.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17854-amyloidosis-aa#prevention\n",
      "Can I prevent AA amyloidosis?\n",
      "You may develop AA amyloidosis if you have a chronic inflammatory disease like rheumatoid arthritis that increases the amount of a certain protein in your bloodstream. As such, the only way you can prevent AA amyloidosis is to seek timely treatment for underlying chronic inflammatory diseases.\n",

      "Adhesions occur when there’s injury or inflammation in your abdomen. They can even form from normal handling during surgery. In fact, they’re most common after abdominal surgery. As a natural part of healing, scar tissue forms that can cause tissues to stiffen and stick together (“adhere”).\n",
      "\n",
      "Abdominal adhesions are the most common consequence of having surgery on your abdomen. The majority of people develop adhesions after abdominal surgery. But most people don’t need treatment unless they’re experiencing symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adhesions are also the most common cause of a small bowel obstruction. A bowel obstruction is a medical emergency that involves complete or partial blockage in your intestines.\n",

      "What are the symptoms of abdominal adhesions?\n",
      "Most adhesions don’t cause symptoms. Sometimes, though, abdominal adhesions can cause your intestines to twist, similar to how a garden hose can become kinked. This can occur shortly after or even years after surgery and lead to a small bowel obstruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "With obstruction, food, liquid, air and waste can’t pass through your intestines. You may notice symptoms such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "Get to an emergency room (ER) immediately if you’re experiencing symptoms of a small bowel obstruction. It can be life-threatening without emergency care.\n",
      "What causes abdominal adhesions?\n",
      "Abdominal adhesions form after your body repairs injured tissue inside your abdominal cavity. They’re like internal scars. If an organ or tissue inside your abdominal cavity is damaged, your immune system triggers inflammation to heal the tissue. As part of the healing process, the damaged tissue forms scar tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the scars that form when you skin your knee, adhesions in your abdomen don’t peel and fade as if they were never there. Instead, damaged surfaces can stick together.\n",

      "Also, additional surgeries cause more adhesions. Think of it this way. Your surgeon can cut bands of tissue that are stuck together so that they become “unstuck.” But as soon as the operation is done, there’s no way to prevent the tissue from sticking together again.\n",
      "\n",
      "For that reason, your healthcare provider will likely avoid surgery unless there’s a major medical problem that needs to be fixed, like a bowel obstruction. You may also need surgery to remove uterine adhesions that prevent you from getting pregnant.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15254-abdominal-adhesions#prevention\n",
      "Can you prevent abdominal adhesions?\n",
      "There’s nothing you or your surgeon can do to prevent abdominal adhesions.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, adhesions are less common with laparoscopic surgery because of the smaller cuts. Increasingly, surgeons choose laparoscopic surgery over open surgery for many abdominal procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your surgeon may also place barriers between tissue surfaces during surgery to prevent scar tissue from causing them to stick together. These barriers come in solid, liquid, gel and spray forms that dissolve in your body. Still, even with barriers, scar tissue is an unavoidable part of the healing process.\n",

      "What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm?\n",
      "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement or bulge in the part of your aorta that extends through your belly or abdomen (abdominal aorta). The bulge forms in an area where your aorta’s wall has grown weak. Normally, your aorta’s wall is strong and flexible enough to manage the constant pressure of blood your heart pumps out. But various factors like aging, tobacco use and certain medical conditions can weaken your aorta’s wall. When the wall is weak, it can’t handle the forces of blood flow as well it should.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the weakened part of your aorta’s wall expands outward and enlarges. This expansion, or ballooning, continues to grow wider over time. Your healthcare provider will diagnose you with an AAA if a segment of your aorta expands to at least 50% of its normal diameter. For many people, this means the bulge is about 3 centimeters (cm) wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The larger an aneurysm grows, the more likely it is to burst open (rupture) and cause life-threatening internal bleeding. AAAs larger than 5.0 centimeters in people assigned female at birth (AFAB) and 5.5 centimeters in people assigned male at birth (AMAB) are particularly at risk. The larger they grow, the more dangerous they become. AAAs usually have no symptoms until they rupture or are close to rupturing. That’s why it’s essential to learn if you have risk factors for an AAA and work with a healthcare provider to manage them.\n",

      "\n",
      "For example, tobacco use causes your aorta’s wall to lose proteins that provide its structure. This reduces its strength. Your aorta’s wall can also grow weaker due to plaque buildup (atherosclerosis). Plaque formation and growth over time can cause inflammation and cell death in the layers of the artery wall. As the building blocks of your aorta’s wall break down, your aorta grows weaker and more vulnerable to abnormal expansion.\n",

      "What is abnormal uterine bleeding (menometrorrhagia)?\n",
      "Abnormal uterine bleeding (formerly called menometrorrhagia) is when you bleed between your monthly periods or when your periods are extremely heavy and/or prolonged. Normal menstrual flow typically lasts about five days and occurs every 21 to 35 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your provider should know about any abnormal bleeding you’re experiencing. What’s causing your bleeding may be harmless. But your bleeding may be a sign of cancer or conditions that may negatively impact your fertility.\n",

      "Menometrorrhagia was once an umbrella term for two different conditions that sound nearly the same:\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2011, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) changed the names to prevent confusion. Menorrhagia is now called heavy menstrual bleeding. Menometrorrhagia is now called abnormal uterine bleeding.\n",
      "Who does it affect?\n",
      "The term “abnormal uterine bleeding” primarily describes bleeding in non-pregnant people in their reproductive years. But this doesn’t mean that irregular bleeding won’t affect you if you’re post-menopausal or pregnant.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re bleeding and have experienced menopause, contact your provider. Bleeding after menopause is never normal. Blood may be red, pink, brown or even rust-like in appearance.\n",

      "You should also contact your provider if you’re bleeding during pregnancy. Some causes are harmless, but others require medical attention, especially if the bleeding happens late in your pregnancy.\n",
      "How common is abnormal uterine bleeding?\n",
      "Not everyone who experiences abnormal uterine bleeding reports their symptoms. As a result, 10% to 35% of women worldwide may have abnormal uterine bleeding. But the numbers may be higher. It’s most common during menarche (when menstruation begins) and perimenopause (the years leading up to menopause).\n",

      "An abrasion is a scrape on your skin. This is a break in your skin that happens when your skin rubs off. It may bleed slightly and hurt. An abrasion often happens when something hits or drags against your skin (friction). Abrasions are usually accidental injuries. They only affect the outermost layers of your skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "An abrasion is similar to using a piece of sandpaper to remove paint from an object. The rough surface of the sandpaper rubbing against the object removes layers of paint just as an abrasion removes some of your skin.\n",

      "There are three types of abrasions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time, an abrasion isn’t a serious injury. An abrasion usually only affects the top layer of your skin (epidermis) and doesn’t extend into deeper layers. While abrasions are common, they can lead to infections. Infection is a serious consequence of a wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "An abrasion and a laceration are types of wounds. A wound is an injury to your skin and body tissues. An abrasion or scrape is a wound where an area of your skin rubs off. None of your skin is missing during a laceration. Instead, the wound breaks apart and separates the skin. Another word for a laceration is a cut.\n",

      "The most common areas where you’ll have symptoms of abrasions are on bony areas of your body, like your knees or elbows. You can get an abrasion anywhere on your skin. Abrasions are also possible in your eye (corneal abrasion) and in your mouth (dental abrasion).\n",
      "What causes an abrasion?\n",
      "Friction causes abrasions. Friction is the movement of a hard, uneven or rough surface, object or material against your skin. Common causes of abrasions include:\n",

      "A healthcare provider may offer a tetanus shot or antibiotics for abrasions caused by animals. This is a preventive form of treatment to reduce your risk of developing an infection. If you received an animal bite or scratch, visit a healthcare provider within 24 hours of the event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try to avoid picking at your abrasion as it heals. It can be tempting to rip off dead skin or scratch your wound. These actions can irritate the wound and delay your healing time.

Small abrasions (less than 2 inches) may heal without scarring, but larger abrasions can leave a scar or mark on your skin after your wound heals. Abrasions aren’t usually severe, but you can get an infection in a minor abrasion like a scrape if you don’t take care of your wound properly. A healthcare provider can treat larger abrasions and offer treatment to prevent infections.\n",

      "What is an abscess?\n",
      "An abscess is a pocket of pus. Abscesses can form almost anywhere in or on your body. When you get an infection, your body's immune system kicks into action to try to fight it. White blood cells travel to the infected area and build up within the damaged tissue. This buildup leads to inflammation, which causes a pocket to form. The pocket fills with pus, creating an abscess. Pus is made up of living and dead white blood cells, germs, fluid and dead tissue.\n",
      "What are the different types of abscesses?\n",
      "There are many different kinds of abscesses. Abscesses can develop on your skin, in your mouth or around an internal organ.\n",

      "What does an abscess look like?\n",
      "An abscess under your skin is easy to see. It may appear red, raised and swollen. The skin over the center of the abscess may be thin. It may look yellow or white because there’s pus underneath the surface of your skin. The abscess may feel tender and warm to the touch. Other symptoms of a skin abscess include pain, fever and chills.\n",
      "\n",
      "An abscess in your mouth may cause a severe toothache. A gum abscess looks like swelling on your gums. Sometimes your jaw, floor of your mouth or cheeks may swell as well. Other symptoms of mouth abscesses include:\n",

      "For deeper skin abscesses or those inside your body, symptoms aren’t as obvious. Some symptoms relate to the part of your body that’s affected. You may experience:\n",
      "How does an abscess form?\n",
      "Bacterial infections usually cause abscesses. A bacteria called Staphylococcus causes most abscesses. When bacteria enter your body, your immune system sends white blood cells to go fight the infection. This process causes inflammation, and the tissue nearby dies. When this happens, a pocket forms and fills with pus, creating an abscess.\n",
      "\n",

      "How is an abscess diagnosed?\n",
      "Your healthcare provider can diagnose a skin abscess during a physical examination. They’ll look at the abscess and ask about your symptoms. They may collect a sample of the pus from your abscess for testing. With the sample, your healthcare provider can identify the type of bacteria causing the abscess. This can help them decide on the best course of treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deeper abscesses, including internal abscesses, are harder to diagnose since you can’t see them. Your healthcare provider may need to order imaging tests. These tests may include:\n",

      "How is an abscess treated?\n",
      "A very small abscess or one close to the surface of your skin may resolve by itself. You may be able to get rid of an abscess by applying a warm compress to the area. It may drain naturally, but you shouldn’t attempt to drain or burst an abscess at home. If you try to squeeze the pus out of an abscess yourself, it can easily spread the bacteria to other areas of your skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic. But treatment for an abscess may also require surgical drainage. First, your healthcare provider will apply a local anesthetic to the area around the abscess. With local anesthesia, you’ll stay awake but the area will be numb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your healthcare provider will make a tiny cut (incision) in the abscess. They’ll allow the abscess to drain and remove any remaining pus, dead tissue and debris. They’ll leave the abscess open to allow any remaining pus to drain. (For larger abscesses, they may pack the open abscess with gauze.) Then, they’ll apply a clean, dry bandage to the area. The incision will heal on its own. You may have a scar at the incision site. A scar can tell you your abscess is healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get rid of an abscess on your gums, your dentist will perform a surgical drainage procedure. Depending on the severity of the abscess, they may have to perform a root canal or pull any affected teeth (tooth extraction). They may prescribe antibiotics as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "For internal abscesses, your healthcare provider may perform a needle aspiration. Depending on the location of the abscess, you’ll receive local or general anesthesia. Then, they’ll guide a needle into place using an ultrasound or CT scan. They’ll drain the abscess using the needle. They may make a small incision in your skin and insert a thin plastic tube called a drainage catheter. The catheter allows the abscess to drain into a bag. You may have to leave the bag in place for a week or more.\n",

With treatment, the abscess will have the opportunity to drain properly and clear up. If you don’t get a skin abscess drained, it can continue to grow and fill with pus until it bursts. A burst abscess can be very painful and cause the infection to spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment for tooth and other mouth abscesses is especially important. Untreated tooth abscesses can kill you. Untreated infections can spread to surrounding tissues in your body. This can cause serious complications including sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis, which can lead to death.\n",

      "Can a tooth abscess go away by itself?\n",
      "A tooth abscess won’t go away on its own. Pain may stop if an infection causes the pulp inside your tooth to die. The pain stops because the nerve isn’t functioning anymore, so you may not be able to feel it. However, the bacteria will continue to spread and destroy surrounding tissue. If you have tooth abscess symptoms, see your dentist even if you no longer have pain.\n",
      "How long can a dental abscess go untreated?\n",
      "Left untreated, a tooth abscess will eventually spread to the surrounding tissues and beyond, wreaking havoc on your oral and overall health.

      "Most seizures last between five seconds and 30 seconds, but they can last for a few minutes, although this is less common. The longer the seizure lasts, the more likely it’ll be noticed by others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absence seizures may be frequent, 10 to more than 30 times a day. Some children can have hundreds of absence seizures a day.\n",
      "What happens after an absence seizure ends?\n",
      "Your child usually continues whatever they were doing before the seizure. They’re usually able to think clearly and are wide awake. However, if more than one seizure happens close together, your child may look or act confused and lose their place in what’s going on around them. For example, during the seizure, they may miss hearing instructions from teachers or what has been said in a conversation.\n",
      "Do only children get absence seizures?\n",
      "Although anyone can have absence seizures, they’re more common in children. They’re usually seen in children between 2 and 12 years of age, and most commonly occur in children of early elementary school age, between the ages of 5 and 7.\n",
      "How common are absence seizures?\n",
      "Absence seizures occur in about 5 people in every 100,000 of all ages, and in 6 to 8 in every 100,000 children younger than 15 years of age. About 10% of all childhood epilepsies and seizures are absence seizures.\n",
      "Can you outgrow absence seizures?\n",
      "There’s a high chance (up to75%) your child will grow out of absence seizures by adolescence. Children who have only absence seizures and not absence seizures combined with other seizure types have the best chance of outgrowing them.\n",
      "What can trigger absence seizures?\n",
      "The triggers for absence seizures are the same as for other types of epilepsy.\n",

      "What are the symptoms of an absence seizure?\n",
      "Absence seizure symptoms include:\n",
      "What causes absence seizures?\n",
      "Researchers believe genetics plays a role in all generalized epilepsy types, which includes absence seizures. Several genes are thought to be involved. Specific details about inheritance still aren’t known.\n",
      "What are generalized seizures?\n",
      "There are two main groups of seizures: generalized seizures and focal seizures. Absence seizures are a type of generalized seizure. These seizures begin with brief abnormal electrical activity that involves both sides of the brain at the same time.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22194-absence-seizures#diagnosis-and-tests\n",
      "How are absence seizures diagnosed?\n",
      "Your healthcare provider makes the diagnosis of absence epilepsy based on symptoms, a hyperventilation test and results of an electroencephalogram (EEG) test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be prepared to describe your child’s symptoms, including what happened before, during and after the event. This information may come from you or other family members or school staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hyperventilating can trigger an absence seizure. To help make the diagnosis, your healthcare provider may want your child to perform this test. If so, your child will be asked to blow repeatedly for more than two minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your healthcare provider will order an electroencephalogram test. During this test, the electrical activity of their brain is monitored through sensors placed on your child’s scalp. Absence seizures are diagnosed by a particular type of brain wave pattern.\n",
      "What is an atypical absence seizure?\n",
      "Healthcare providers define absence seizures as typical or atypical. Atypical seizures are recognized by their own unique EEG pattern and can occur at any age. This seizure type usually starts and ends more slowly and lasts longer (20 seconds or more) than typical absence seizures. Atypical absence seizures also usually cause more muscle movement in a person, such as smacking lips or chewing movements, more eye blinking and rubbing fingers together or other hand motions. Atypical absence seizures usually occur with other seizure types and more often affect children who have a learning disability and severe epilepsy.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22194-absence-seizures#management-and-treatment\n",
      "How are absence seizures treated?\n",
      "Absence seizures are treated with antiseizure medications. Ethosuximide (Zarontin®) is the preferred medication to treat absence seizures. Other medications that your healthcare provider might try include valproate (Depakene®), lamotrigine (Lamictal®) and topiramate (Topamax®).\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain types of antiseizure medications, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin and vigabatrin, aren’t usually used to treat absence seizures. These drugs can worsen seizures.\n",
      "\n",
      "A ketogenic diet may be considered, but good evidence to support its use is lacking. A ketogenic diet may be considered if your child’s absence seizures don’t respond to medication.\n",
      "What follow-up should be expected if my child has been diagnosed with absence seizures?\n",
      "A team of healthcare specialists usually manages individuals with epilepsy. Team members may include a neurologist/child neurologist, primary care provider, pharmacist, nurse, dietitian and mental health professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be sure to let your doctors or pharmacist know if your child’s symptoms aren’t controlled or if they experience any adverse reactions. A change in drug dose or type may need to be made. Your neurologist or primary care doctor will monitor blood levels and liver function (depending on the medication used) with occasional blood tests. A dietitian may be consulted if a ketogenic diet is recommended. If your child develops anxiety, depression or stress, a mental health professional may become involved.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22194-absence-seizures#prevention\n",
      "Can absence seizures be prevented?\n",
      "Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to prevent absence seizures, since genetics are thought to play a role in their cause.\n",
      "What activities should my child with absence seizure avoid?\n",
      "Your child shouldn’t swim, dive or rock climb without supervision. Your child also shouldn’t drive unless seizures are controlled with medication.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22194-absence-seizures#outlook-prognosis\n",
      "What can I expect if my child has absence seizure?\n",
      "Most children respond to treatment with anticonvulsant medication. In most children — up to 75% — absence seizures goes away by their teen years and medications are no longer needed.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22194-absence-seizures#additional-common-questions\n",
      "If the seizures are only brief, do they really need to be treated?\n",
      "Even though absence seizures occur for a very short period of time, they are not harmless. Your child is experiencing seizure episodes that alter their consciousness. Seizures can interfere with learning (for example, missing what is being taught during seizure episodes), which can impact school performance. Seizures also affect your child’s physical safety, increasing the risk of accidents.\n",
      "How can I tell the difference between daydreaming and absence seizure in my child?\n",
      "If your child is daydreaming, attention can be regained immediately when your child is spoken to by you, or a teacher or a friend. Daydreaming usually is brought on by boredom and comes on slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your child is having an absence seizure, the inattention comes on suddenly, can’t be interrupted and can happen anytime – including during a physical activity. It ends on its own, usually within 20 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "A note from Cleveland Clinic\n",
      "Absence seizures cause a short-term lapse in awareness. Because they typically last fewer than 20 seconds per episode, and because they’re more common in elementary school-aged children, they may be difficult to detect. In fact, they’re often first discovered by your child’s teachers, by not responding when called upon or by slipping academic performance. The good news is that up to 75% of children who have absence seizures alone outgrow their seizures during their teenage years and no longer require medication.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21560-acanthamoeba-keratitis#overview\n",
      "What is acanthamoeba keratitis?\n",
      "Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is a rare parasitic eye infection from a certain type of amoeba. It affects the cornea, the clear, dome-shaped front covering of your eye. When not treated, it can damage your eyes and cause loss of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "This condition is sometimes known as “amoebic keratitis” or by similar names. AK usually affects one eye at a time, but it can affect both. It starts by affecting the outermost layer of your cornea, the epithelium. As it gets worse, the infection extends deeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "An amoeba is a single-celled organism. It‘s similar to bacteria but a little more complex. It isn‘t a true parasite because it can go through its entire life cycle without needing to infect humans or any other animals. But amoebas act like parasites when they infect humans or animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists know of at least 20 species of acanthamoeba worldwide. They can live almost anywhere humans do, and they easily survive in freshwater, seawater, soil and many other places. Researchers know of eight (possibly nine) acanthamoeba species that can cause AK.\n",
      "\n",
      "During their life cycles, acanthamoeba can take two forms. One is their active, mobile form. The other is their cyst form. This form involves a toughened outer layer. In cyst form, acanthamoeba can survive all kinds of threats that would kill them otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "That includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that is important because acanthamoeba can enter your body both in active and cyst forms. That’s why you should take proper precautions to prevent them from infecting you.\n",
      "\n",
      "AK is rare overall. Research indicates there could be up to 1,500 cases in the U.S. each year.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21560-acanthamoeba-keratitis#symptoms-and-causes\n",
      "What are the symptoms of acanthamoeba keratitis?\n",
      "The symptoms of AK happen when the active form of these microbes enters the corneas of your eyes. The symptoms may not remain constant, cycling back and forth between better and worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms include:\n",
      "What causes acanthamoeba keratitis?\n",
      "Two species of acanthamoeba cause most cases of AK (experts abbreviate “acanthamoeba” to “A.” in the species names). The two species are A. castellani and A. polyphaga.\n",
      "\n",
      "AK is infectious (meaning you can catch it), but it isn’t contagious (you can’t directly catch it from someone else).\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common ways for acanthamoeba to infect your eyes are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Contact lens wearers make up at least 90% of AK cases. That’s usually because of a combination of factors. The factors include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Acanthamoeba can survive in water easily, especially in cyst form. Even treated drinking water, bottled water or swimming pool water may not have a high enough chlorine concentration or other disinfectants. That’s why you should never use tap water with contacts or wear contacts while swimming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under ordinary circumstances, acanthamoeba from these sources can’t infect your eyes. But there are times when they can. Some include:\n",
      "\n",
      "The cornea is like your eye‘s windshield, but injuries make it less effective. The injuries are like weak points or small gaps in the cornea surface where it‘s easier for microbes to get in. Injuries to your corneas usually involve contact lenses, your fingers or fingernails, plants or plant material, or dirt or soil.\n",
      "What are the complications of acanthamoeba keratitis?\n",
      "There are a few main complications that are possible with AK:\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21560-acanthamoeba-keratitis#diagnosis-and-tests\n",
      "How is acanthamoeba keratitis diagnosed?\n",
      "AK is tricky to diagnose early on, and an initial misdiagnosis happens in about 75% to 90% of cases. That’s because of the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Your eye care specialist will do an eye exam, including a slit lamp exam. That lets them look into your eyes for signs or clues. They’ll also ask about your symptoms, recent activities or if there could be other contributing factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The standard practice is to treat any eye infection as if it were viral or bacterial first and suspect it’s AK if treatment doesn’t work. If it doesn’t, your eye care specialist will likely recommend starting treatment for AK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing for AK may involve taking samples of corneal tissue. That can involve:\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of these tests are more invasive and can be painful. But your provider will use numbing drops or medications to help with that. Corneas also regenerate quickly, which reduces how long you feel pain or discomfort from a scraping or biopsy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wait time for results from corneal tissue testing can take several days. Your provider will likely begin treatment to help with your symptoms in the meantime.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21560-acanthamoeba-keratitis#management-and-treatment\n",
      "How is acanthamoeba keratitis treated, and is there a cure?\n",
      "Treating AK has two main goals: getting rid of the infection and reducing pain and other disruptive symptoms. Medications are usually the first option, and surgery may be necessary in more severe cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the more common AK medications aren’t available in the United States anymore because the condition is so rare. But some pharmacies may be able to custom-make (compound) these medications for you. Your eye care specialist is the best person to tell you about medication options and where you might be able to get them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Active forms of acanthamoeba are very sensitive to certain medications. In cyst form, acanthamoeba species can resist treatment, but some medications can still overcome that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main form of treatment is topical antiseptic drops, such as chlorhexidine and polihexanide (also known as polyhexamethylene biguanide, or PHMB).\n",
      "\n",
      "About 40% of AK cases don’t respond well enough to medication alone. When that happens, surgery may be the next best option. This can include:\n",

      "What can I expect if I have acanthamoeba keratitis?\n",
      "AK is a condition that can be very painful — often much more than your other symptoms or visible eye changes would suggest — and disruptive. It’s important not to ignore it because it gets harder to treat the longer you wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have AK, your eye care specialist will first try to treat and/or rule out viral and bacterial infections. Make sure you follow up with them and know how long to wait before contacting them again if treatment doesn‘t seem to be helping.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also important to follow your provider’s treatment instructions exactly as guided. That gives you the best chance of a favorable outcome. If you don‘t follow your provider‘s treatment instructions, you may be prone to reinfection. The cyst form can also live dormant in your corneas for extended periods, which can cause AK symptoms to return months after treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "AK can cause severe and permanent damage if it goes untreated for too long. The possible complications include glaucoma, iris atrophy (shrinking or moving out of place), cataracts and chronic defects in the cornea’s outermost layer. In more severe cases, major vision loss is possible.\n",
      "What’s the outlook for this condition?\n",
      "The outlook for AK depends on several factors. Positive outcomes are much more likely if you get medical care before this condition spreads past the second layer of your cornea. That usually means starting treatment within three weeks of when your symptoms start.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should see an eye care specialist if you have AK symptoms lasting more than a few days. Doing so will allow them time to try bacterial infection treatments, and if those don‘t work, your eye specialist can have you begin AK-specific treatments.\n",

      "But if a person of any age takes more than the recommended dose of acetaminophen, the result can be acetaminophen toxicity. This is a dangerous situation. Your liver can’t process excessive doses of the medication. If your child takes too much acetaminophen (or takes the recommended amount for too long) toxins can build up in their body. This toxicity can cause vomiting, liver damage and death. It’s important to deal with the situation quickly.\n",

      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17534-achalasia#overview\n",
      "What is achalasia?\n",
      "Achalasia is a rare disorder in which your esophagus is unable to move food and liquids down into your stomach. Your esophagus is the muscular tube that transports food from your mouth to your stomach. At the area where your esophagus meets your stomach is a ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This muscle relaxes (opens) to allow food to enter your stomach and contracts (tightens to close) to prevent stomach content from backing up into your esophagus. If you have achalasia, the LES doesn’t relax, which prevents food from moving into your stomach.\n",
      "Who gets achalasia?\n",
      "Achalasia develops in about 1 in every 100,000 people in the U.S. each year. It is typically diagnosed in adults between the ages of 25 and 60, but can occur in children as well (less than 5% of cases are in children under age 16). No particular race or ethnic group is more affected than others, and the condition does not run in families (except possibly in a rare form of the disorder). Men and women are equally affected.\n",
      "Is achalasia serious?\n",
      "Yes, it can be, especially if it goes untreated. If you have achalasia, you’ll gradually experience increased trouble eating solid foods and drinking liquids. Achalasia can cause considerable weight loss and malnutrition. People with achalasia also have a small increased risk of developing esophageal cancer, particularly if the condition has been present for a long time. Your healthcare provider may recommend regular screenings of your esophagus to catch cancer early if it were to develop.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17534-achalasia#symptoms-and-causes\n",
      "What causes achalasia?\n",
      "Why your esophageal muscles fail to contract and relax normally is unknown. One theory is that achalasia is an autoimmune disease (your body attacks itself) that is triggered by a virus. Your immune system attacks the nerve cells in the muscle layers of the walls of your esophagus and at the LES. Your nerve cells, which control muscle function, slowly degenerate for reasons that are not currently understood. This results in excessive contractions in the LES. If you have achalasia, the LES fails to relax and food and liquids can’t pass through your esophagus into your stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rare form of achalasia may be inherited. More research is needed.\n",
      "What are the symptoms of achalasia?\n",
      "Achalasia symptoms develop slowly, with symptoms lasting for months or years. Symptoms include:\n",
      "What are the complications of achalasia?\n",
      "Some complications of achalasia are the result of food backing up (regurgitating) into your esophagus and then drawn into (aspirated) your trachea (windpipe), which leads to your lungs. These complications include:\n",

      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17534-achalasia#management-and-treatment\n",
      "How is achalasia treated?\n",
      "Several treatments are available for achalasia including nonsurgical options (balloon dilation, medications, and botulinum toxin injection) and surgical options. The goal of treatment is to relieve your symptoms by relaxing your lower esophageal sphincter (LES).\n",
      "\n",
      "Your healthcare provider will discuss these options so you both can decide the best treatment for you based on the severity of your condition and your preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minimally Invasive Surgery\n",
      "\n",
      "The surgery used to treat achalasia is called laparoscopic esophagomyotomy or laparoscopic Heller myotomy. In this minimally invasive surgery, a thin, telescopic-like instrument called an endoscope is inserted through a small incision. The endoscope is connected to a tiny video camera – smaller than a dime –that projects a view of the operative site onto video monitors located in the operating room. In this operation, the muscle fibers of the LES are cut. The addition of another procedure called a partial fundoplication helps prevent gastroesophageal reflux, a side effect of the Heller myotomy procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a minimally invasive alternative to laparascopic Heller myotomy. In this procedure, muscles on the side of the esophagus, the LES and the upper part of the stomach are cut with a knife. The cuts in these areas loosen the muscles, allowing the esophagus to empty like it normally should, passing food down into your stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Balloon dilation\n",
      "\n",
      "In this non-surgical procedure, you’ll be put under light sedation while a specifically designed balloon is inserted through the LES and then inflated. The procedure relaxes the muscle sphincter, which allows food to enter your stomach. Balloon dilation is usually the first treatment option in people in whom surgery fails.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may have to undergo several dilation treatments to relieve your symptoms, and every few years to maintain relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medication\n",
      "\n",
      "If you aren’t a candidate for balloon dilation or surgery or choose not to undergo these procedures, you may benefit from Botox® (botulinum toxin) injections. Botox is a protein made by the bacteria that cause botulism. When injected into muscles in very small quantities, Botox can relax spastic muscles. It works by blocking the signal from the nerves to the sphincter muscles that tell them to contract. Injections need to be repeated to maintain symptom control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other medication treatments include nifedipine (Procardia XL®, Adalat CC®) or isosorbide (Imdur®, Monoket®). These medications relax the spastic esophageal muscles by lowering LES pressure. These treatments are less effective than surgery or balloon dilation and provide only short-term relief of your symptoms.\n",

      "Complications of achalasia treatments include:\n",
      "What post-treatment follow-up is needed?\n",
      "Long-term follow-up is needed regardless of which treatment you receive. This is because treatments are palliative – meaning they relieve symptoms – and do not cure achalasia or halt its progression. Symptoms can return. Your healthcare provider will want to see if your esophagus is adequately allowing food to enter your stomach and to check for gastroesophageal reflux, which would need to be treated. Your doctor will also want to monitor you to be sure cancer has not developed.\n",

      "What is an Achilles tendon rupture?\n",
      "The Achilles tendon attaches the calf muscle to the heel bone. This thick band of tissue is very strong. In fact the Achilles tendon is the largest and strongest tendon in the body. The Achilles tendon gives your leg strength to walk, run and jump.\n",
      "\n",
      "An Achilles tendon rupture is a full or partial tear of the Achilles tendon. This acute (sudden) injury occurs when the tendon stretches to its breaking point. It happens most frequently while playing sports. Tripping, falling or twisting your ankle can also cause an Achilles tear.\n",
      "How common are ruptured Achilles tendons?\n",
      "Achilles tendon ruptures are very common sports injuries. They occur most frequently in people ages 30 to 40 and are more common in men than in women.\n",

      "What causes an Achilles tendon rupture?\n",
      "Sudden movement that puts stress on the Achilles tendon can lead to a rupture. Typically, people tear the Achilles tendon while playing sports. The biggest culprits are sports with sudden stops, starts and pivots — such as soccer, football, basketball, tennis or squash. Achilles tendon tears aren’t always a sports injury. You can tear your Achilles tendon by tripping, missing a step when going downstairs or accidentally stepping into a hole and twisting your ankle. Some medications — including certain antibiotics and steroid injections in the area — can weaken the Achilles tendon. This can put you at a higher risk for a tear.\n",
      "What are the symptoms of a torn Achilles tendon?\n",
      "The classic sign of a ruptured Achilles tendon is feeling (and sometimes hearing) a pop or snap at the back of your ankle. People often mistakenly think something has hit them, but they’re actually feeling the tendon snap.\n",

      "Symptoms of GERD in babies (or small children) may include:\n",
      "What causes acid reflux?\n",
      "For acid to get into your esophagus, it needs to get past the valve at the bottom of your esophagus that usually keeps things from coming back up. This valve is called your lower esophageal sphincter (LES).\n",
      "\n",
      "Your LES is a circular muscle that opens when you swallow and then closes again to keep substances in your stomach. It also opens a little to let gas bubbles out when you’re burping or have hiccups.\n",

      "What is anorexia nervosa?\n",
      "Anorexia, formally known as anorexia nervosa, is an eating disorder. People with anorexia limit the number of calories and the types of food they eat. Eventually, they lose weight or cannot maintain an appropriate body weight based on their height, age, stature and physical health. They may exercise compulsively and/or purge the food they eat through intentional vomiting and/or misuse of laxatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals with anorexia also have a distorted self-image of their body and have an intense fear of gaining weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anorexia is a serious condition that requires treatment. Extreme weight loss in people with anorexia can lead to malnutrition, dangerous health problems and even death.\n",
      "Who does anorexia affect?\n",
      "Anorexia can occur in people of any age, sex, gender, race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and economic status and individuals of all body weights, shapes and sizes. Anorexia most commonly affects adolescents and young adult women, although it also occurs in men and is increasing in numbers in children and older adults.\n",
      "How common is anorexia?\n",
      "Eating disorders affect at least 9% of the worldwide population, and anorexia affects approximately 1% to 2% of the population. It affects 0.3% of adolescents.\n",
      "What is the difference between anorexia and bulimia?\n",
      "Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are both eating disorders. They can have similar symptoms, such as distorted body image and an intense fear of gaining weight. The difference is that they have different food-related behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "People who have anorexia severely reduce their calorie intake and/or purge to lose weight. People who have bulimia eat an excessive amount of food in a short period of time (binge eating) followed by certain behaviors to prevent weight gain. Such behaviors include:\n",
      "\n",
      "People with bulimia usually maintain their weight at optimal or slightly above optimal levels whereas people with anorexia typically have a body mass index (BMI) that is below 18.45 kg/m2 (kilogram per square meter).\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9794-anorexia-nervosa#symptoms-and-causes\n",
      "What are the signs and symptoms of anorexia?\n",
      "You cannot tell if a person has anorexia just by their appearance because anorexia also involves mental and behavioral components — not just physical. A person does not need to be underweight to have anorexia. Larger-bodied individuals can also have anorexia. However, they may be less likely to be diagnosed due to cultural stigma against fat and obesity. In addition, someone can be underweight without having anorexia. Remember, anorexia also includes psychological and behavioral components as well as physical.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several emotional, behavioral and physical signs and symptoms of anorexia. If you or someone you know experiences the signs and symptoms of anorexia below, it’s important to seek help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emotional and mental signs of anorexia include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Behavioral signs of anorexia include:\n",
      "\n",
      "The most well-known physical sign of anorexia is low body weight for a person’s height, sex and stature. However, it’s important to remember that someone can have anorexia without being underweight. In addition to weight-related signs of anorexia, there are also physical symptoms that are actually side effects of starvation and malnutrition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical signs of anorexia include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical symptoms of anorexia that are side effects of starvation and malnutrition include:\n",
      "What causes anorexia?\n",
      "Anorexia and all eating disorders are complex conditions. For this reason, the exact cause of anorexia is unknown, but research suggests that a combination of certain genetic factors, psychological traits and environmental factors, especially sociocultural factors, might be responsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Factors that may be involved in developing anorexia include:\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s important to note that there’s no single path to an eating disorder or anorexia. For many people, irregular eating behaviors (also called “disordered eating”) represent an inappropriate coping strategy that becomes permanent over time. This pathway to disordered eating is true for some, but not all, who develop anorexia.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9794-anorexia-nervosa#diagnosis-and-tests\n",
      "How is anorexia diagnosed?\n",
      "A healthcare provider can diagnose a person with anorexia based on the criteria for anorexia nervosa listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) published by the American Psychiatric Association. The three criteria for anorexia nervosa under the DSM-5 include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if all of the DSM-5 criteria for anorexia aren’t met, a person can still have a serious eating disorder. DSM-5 criteria classifies the severity of anorexia according to body mass index (BMI). Individuals who meet the criteria for anorexia but who aren’t underweight despite significant weight loss have what’s known as atypical anorexia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnostic guidelines in the DSM-5 also allow healthcare providers to determine if a person is in partial remission (recovery) or full remission as well as to specify the current severity of the condition based on body mass index (BMI).\n",
      "\n",
      "If signs and symptoms of anorexia are present, a healthcare provider will begin an evaluation by performing a complete medical history and physical examination. The provider or a mental health professional will likely ask questions about the following topics:\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s important to remember that a person with anorexia or any eating disorder will have the best recovery outcome if they receive an early diagnosis. If you or someone you know is experiencing signs and symptoms of anorexia, be sure to talk to a healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n",
      "What tests are used to diagnose or assess anorexia?\n",
      "Although there are no laboratory tests to specifically diagnose anorexia, a healthcare provider may use various diagnostic tests, such as blood tests, to rule out any medical conditions that could cause weight loss and to evaluate the physical damage weight loss and starvation may have caused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tests to rule out weight-loss causing illness or to assess anorexia side effects may include:\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9794-anorexia-nervosa#management-and-treatment\n",
      "How is anorexia treated?\n",
      "The biggest challenge in treating anorexia is helping the person recognize and accept that they have an illness. Many people with anorexia deny that they have an eating disorder. They often seek medical treatment only when their condition is serious or life-threatening. This is why it’s important to diagnose and treat anorexia in its beginning stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goals of treatment for anorexia include:\n",
      "\n",
      "People with eating disorders, including anorexia, often have additional mental health conditions, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "These conditions can further complicate anorexia, so if an individual has one or more of these conditions, their healthcare team will likely recommend treatment for the condition(s) as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment options will vary depending on the individual’s needs. A person may receive treatment through residential care (outpatient care) or hospitalization depending on their current medical and mental health state. Treatment for anorexia most often involves a combination of the following strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychotherapy is a type of individual counseling that focuses on changing the thinking (cognitive therapy) and behavior (behavioral therapy) of a person with an eating disorder. Treatment includes practical techniques for developing healthy attitudes toward food and weight, as well as approaches for changing the way the person responds to difficult situations. There are several types of psychotherapy, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "Some healthcare providers may prescribe medication to help manage anxiety and depression that are often associated with anorexia. The antipsychotic medication olanzapine (Zyprexa®) may be helpful for weight gain. Sometimes, providers prescribe medications to help with period regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nutrition counseling is a strategy to help treat anorexia that involves the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Family support is very important to anorexia treatment success. Family members must understand the eating disorder and recognize its signs and symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "People with eating disorders might also benefit from group therapy, where they can find support and openly discuss their feelings and concerns with others who share common experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hospitalization might be needed to treat severe weight loss that has resulted in malnutrition and other serious mental or physical health complications, such as heart disorders, serious depression and suicidal thoughts or behaviors.\n",
      "Are there complications related to treating anorexia?\n",
      "The most serious complication of treating anorexia is a condition called refeeding syndrome. This life-threatening condition can occur when a seriously malnourished person begins to receive nutrition again. Basically, their body cannot properly restart the metabolism process.\n",
      "\n",
      "People experiencing refeeding syndrome can develop the following conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Since refeeding syndrome can have serious and life-threatening side effects, it’s essential for people with anorexia to receive medical treatment and/or guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "People who have one or more of the following risk factors for developing refeeding syndrome may need to be treated in a hospital:\n",
      "How long does it take to recover from anorexia?\n",
      "Every person’s anorexia recovery journey is different. The important thing to remember is that it is possible to recover from anorexia. Treatment for anorexia often involves many components, such as psychological therapy, nutritional counseling and addressing the cause of the person’s anorexia, if possible, and each of these components can take different amounts of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter where you or a loved one are in their journey of recovery, it’s essential to continue working toward recovery.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9794-anorexia-nervosa#prevention\n",
      "What are the risk factors for developing anorexia?\n",
      "Anorexia can affect anyone, no matter their gender, age or race. However, certain factors put some people at greater risk for developing anorexia, including:\n",
      "Can anorexia be prevented?\n",
      "Although it might not be possible to prevent all cases of anorexia, it’s helpful to start treatment as soon as someone begins to have symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, teaching and encouraging healthy eating habits and realistic attitudes about food and body image also might help prevent the development or worsening of eating disorders. If your child or family member decides to become vegetarian or vegan, for instance, it’s worth seeing a dietitian versed in eating disorders and touching base with your pediatrician or healthcare provider to make sure that this change occurs without a loss in nutrients.\n",
      "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9794-anorexia-nervosa#outlook-prognosis\n",
      "What is the outlook (prognosis) for people with anorexia?\n",
      "The prognosis for anorexia varies depending on certain factors, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "Anorexia, like other eating disorders, gets worse the longer it’s left untreated. The sooner the disorder is diagnosed and treated, the better the outcome. However, people with anorexia often will not admit they have a problem and might resist treatment or refuse to follow the treatment plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anorexia is a serious and potentially life-threatening eating disorder if it’s left untreated. Eating disorders, including anorexia, are among the deadliest mental health conditions, second only to opioid addiction. Individuals with anorexia are 5 times more likely to die prematurely and 18 times more likely to die by suicide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that anorexia can be treated, and someone with anorexia can return to a healthy weight and healthy eating patterns. Unfortunately, the risk of relapse is high, so recovery from anorexia usually requires long-term treatment as well as a strong commitment by the individual. Support of family members and friends can help ensure that the person receives and adheres to their needed treatment.\n",
      "What are the complications of anorexia?\n",
      "The medical complications and health risks of malnutrition and starvation, which are common in people who have anorexia, can affect nearly every organ in your body. In severe cases, vital organs such as your brain, heart and kidneys can sustain damage. This damage may be irreversible even after a person has recovered from anorexia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Severe medical complications that can happen from untreated anorexia include:\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to physical complications, people with anorexia also commonly have other mental health conditions, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "If these mental health conditions are left untreated, they could lead to self-injury, suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re having suicidal thoughts, call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988. Someone will be available to talk with you 24/7.\n",

      "How do I take care of myself if I have anorexia?\n",
      "It can be uncomfortable and scary, but it’s important to tell a loved one and/or your healthcare provider if you have anorexia.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have already been diagnosed with anorexia, there are some things you can do to manage your condition and stay committed to recovery, including:\n",
      "How can I care for a loved one who has anorexia?\n",
      "There are multiple things you can do to help and support someone with anorexia, including:\n",
      "When should I see my healthcare provider?\n",
      "If you or someone you know is experiencing signs and symptoms of anorexia, be sure to talk to a healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n",
      "When should a person with anorexia go to the emergency room?\n",
      "Someone with anorexia should go to the emergency room (ER) if they’re experiencing any of the following physical symptoms:\n",
