       "{'Milk Allergy_overview1': \"A milk allergy is one of the most common types of food allergy. Your immune system overreacts to one or more of the proteins in milk you've ingested (eaten or drunk). Cow's milk is the most common cause of a milk allergy. However, other types of animal milk, including goat's milk and sheep's milk, may cause your immune system to react. You may have a true milk allergy as a result of an immune system reaction. There are also other reactions to foods as well, including: Milk protein intolerance in infants. Lactose intolerance in older children and adults. A milk allergy can be deadly.

Cow's milk is the most common cause of a milk allergy. However, other types of animal milk, including goat's milk and sheep's milk, may cause your immune system to react. You may have a true milk allergy as a result of an immune system reaction. There are also other reactions to foods as well, including: Milk protein intolerance in infants.

A milk allergy causes an allergic reaction in your body. An allergic reaction is your body's response to an allergen. If you have a milk allergy, your body responds by creating immunoglobulin E (IgE) after your first exposure to milk. IgE are antibodies your immune system makes.

Your body makes many different types of IgE, which target specific kinds of allergens. IgE antibodies bind to mast cells (allergy cells) in your skin, respiratory tract (airways) and cardiovascular system. When they encounter milk proteins, they release histamine. Histamine is what causes your allergy symptoms. IgE reactions happen quickly after ingesting milk. Reactions may include anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction that may cause death. Other reactions to milk aren't the result of the allergy antibody. Your reaction to milk is slower than an IgE-mediated reaction. It may take up to 48 hours to develop. Milk is one of the most common triggers for a non-IgE reaction in babies. Most non-IgE food allergies, including milk, aren't life-threatening. Reactions may include milk protein intolerance. No, a milk allergy isn't the same as lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance (dairy intolerance) is the inability to digest lactose. Lactose is a sugar that's in many dairy products. Lactose intolerance causes bloating, cramps and diarrhea after eating or drinking products that contain lactose. It's more common in adults than babies and young children. A milk allergy is when your immune system overreacts to one or more of the proteins in milk. It usually has more serious symptoms than lactose intolerance. Milk allergies are more common in babies and young children.\\n\\nwhat is milk allergy? what causes it [/INST]\\nMilk allergy is a type of food allergy where your immune system overreacts to one or more of the proteins in milk you've ingested. The most common cause of a milk allergy is cow's milk, but other types of animal milk like goat's and sheep's milk may also cause an immune system reaction. Milk allergies can be deadly if you have severe allergic reaction symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, so it's important to seek medical attention immediately if you experience these symptoms.\"}"
