            "What is babesiosis?": "Babesiosis (pronounced \u201cbuh-BEE-zee-oh-sis\u201d) is an illness you get from many species (types) of the parasite Babesia. You can get it through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks or from an organ transplant.\n\nBabesiosis usually causes flu-like symptoms. But the parasite\u2019s destruction of red blood cells can lead to life-threatening complications, especially if you have a weakened immune system. A common complication is hemolytic anemia, a condition where your red blood cells are destroyed faster than you can make new ones.\n\nYou can get babesiosis in places where Babesia parasites and the ticks that carry them are found together. These areas are in the U.S., Europe and Asia. In the U.S., it\u2019s mostly found in the Upper Midwest and Northeast, with a few cases on the West Coast. It\u2019s most common in seven states:\n\nBabesiosis is rare, with fewer than 3,000 cases reported in the U.S. each year. But it\u2019s considered an emerging infectious disease, which means the number of cases has increased in recent years."

            "What are the symptoms of babesiosis?": "Symptoms of babesiosis start one to four weeks after exposure. They include:\n\nAbout 1 in 4 people have no symptoms of babesiosis. Unlike other tick-borne diseases, it usually doesn\u2019t cause a rash.\n\nSevere babesiosis may cause additional symptoms, including:\n\nWeight loss isn\u2019t a common sign of babesiosis. But if you don\u2019t feel like eating or are feeling sick to your stomach and vomiting, you might lose weight.",
            "What causes babesiosis?": "Several types of Babesia parasites cause babesiosis. Babesia are protozoa, one-celled organisms that are too small to see without a microscope. They get into your blood through a tick bite. There, they infect and destroy your red blood cells. In mild cases, this can make you tired. In severe cases, like if you have a compromised immune system, the infection can cause life-threatening complications.\n\nB. microti is the most common cause of symptomatic babesiosis in the U.S. Other Babesia species that sometimes make you sick include B. duncani, B. divergens, B. venatorum and B. crassa.",
            "How do you get babesiosis?": "Babesiosis spreads from animals to humans when a tick bites an infected animal \u2014 usually a small rodent, like a mouse \u2014 and then bites you. The parasite infects your blood cells and reproduces there.\n\nIn the U.S., the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the most common carrier of the parasite that causes babesiosis. Blacklegged ticks carry many other illnesses, including Lyme disease and anaplasmosis. It\u2019s often called a \u201cdeer tick,\u201d though deer usually don\u2019t carry babesiosis. In Europe, castor bean ticks (I. ricinus) transmit Babesia.\n\nYou can also get babesiosis from a blood transfusion. This happens when a blood donor is infected without knowing it.\n\nNo, babesiosis isn\u2019t contagious from person to person. Rarely, Babesia is transmitted from a pregnant person to the fetus.\n\nBabesiosis is most common in the spring and summer. This is because young ticks (nymphs) come out in the spring and are more likely to spread Babesia than adult ticks.\n\nNymphs are small (about the size of a poppy seed) and can be hard to see. They grow into adults during the summer. You can still get babesiosis from an adult tick, but they\u2019re easier to see, and you\u2019re more likely to remove them before they bite you.\n\nWhile anyone can get babesiosis, you\u2019re at higher risk for getting severely ill if you:",

If your provider treats you with medication, you might start to feel better in a day or two. If you have a weakened immune system, babesiosis can last a long time \u2014 months or years.\n\nSometimes, babesiosis symptoms can get better but come back later (relapse). If this happens, your provider will have to treat you again. You\u2019re most at risk for relapse if you have a weakened immune system.\n\nEven after your other symptoms have gone away, you may still feel tired for several months. You should recover fully once your red blood cell counts return to normal. Ask your provider how long it might take to feel better.\n\nMost people with babesiosis make a full recovery. But babesiosis is fatal in about 1 in 10 people who are hospitalized for it."

Similar to adult acne, symptoms of baby acne include pimples, little bumps or pustules on your baby\u2019s skin. It usually only lasts a few days to a couple of weeks.\n\nOther names for baby acne are newborn acne, neonatal acne or neonatal cephalic pustulosis.\n\nWhile both conditions have the same symptoms, the difference between baby acne and infantile acne is when it affects your child. Baby acne occurs on average around 2 weeks of age. Some babies are born with acne and it goes away within weeks. Infantile acne occurs between 2 months to 1 year. Symptoms of infantile acne can reach beyond pustules and bumps to include blackheads. If your child gets acne after 2 months of age, visit a healthcare provider. It may take longer for infantile acne to clear up.",
            "Who does baby acne affect and how common is it?": "Baby acne can affect any newborn before they turn 2 months old. It\u2019s common and affects nearly 20% or more than 1 in 5 healthy newborns in the United States."

It can look similar to mild adolescent or adult acne. Features of baby acne include:\n\nYour baby\u2019s acne may look more visible when they cry. They also won\u2019t have blackheads if they have baby acne.\n\nBaby acne is common on your child\u2019s face, chest and back. Specifically, it can affect your baby\u2019s:\n\nBaby acne can appear suddenly or develop slowly. Pimples can start as small, discolored dots on their skin before they turn into raised pimples. When the inflammation of the pimples reduces, so does their size. The pimples are temporary and usually go away within a few days to a couple of weeks. After the pimples go away, your baby\u2019s skin will be blemish-free.",
            "What causes baby acne?": "The exact cause of baby acne is unknown. Acne is usually the result of clogged pores. When your pores clog, a pimple can develop.\n\nProviders suspect that baby acne is the result of hormonal changes that affect your newborn during birth or the first few weeks of their life. Hormones in the placenta can affect how your baby\u2019s skin produces sebum. Sebum is an oily substance that the sebaceous glands in your baby\u2019s skin make to protect their skin and hair. Too much sebum can clog pores and lead to acne.\n\nIn addition, babies have sensitive skin when they\u2019re born. Their skin may react negatively to anything that\u2019s left on it for too long, especially if they have food, vomit or drool residue on their skin.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that hormones from a birthing parent\u2019s breast milk (chest milk) can affect your baby\u2019s hormones, which can lead to acne. Baby acne is a temporary skin condition that clears up, most often without any medical treatment. This shouldn\u2019t affect the way that you feed your newborn. Baby acne will go away as your newborn grows and their body adjusts to their new environment. If you have questions about how your breast milk (chest milk) affects your newborn\u2019s skin, talk to your healthcare provider.\n\nAffectionate kisses on your baby\u2019s cheeks when they\u2019re born don\u2019t cause baby acne. Baby acne is usually the result of hormonal changes that cause their pores to temporarily clog."

            "What is Barrett\u2019s esophagus?": "Barrett's esophagus is a change in the cellular structure of your esophagus lining. Your esophagus is the swallowing tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. Like all of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract, your esophagus has a protective mucous lining on the inside. But if something irritates this lining for a long time, it can damage the tissues. Sometimes, this damage actually reprograms the cells. These changes affect the structure and appearance of your esophagus lining. To scientists, it now looks more like the lining of your intestines. They call this intestinal metaplasia. Metaplasia is when tissues in your body replace themselves with a different type of tissue that isn't normally found there. This is a risk factor for cancer. Although the risk is small, metaplasia makes cancerous changes more likely.",
            "How serious is Barrett\u2019s esophagus?": "Because of the small chance it might progress to esophageal cancer, healthcare providers like to keep an eye on Barrett's esophagus. But the risk is only about half a percent per year. Cellular changes happen slowly, and metaplasia passes through another precancerous stage (dysplasia) before progressing to cancer. If your provider notices any dysplasia, they'll remove it to stop it from progressing further."

            "What are the symptoms of Barrett\u2019s esophagus?": "On its own, Barrett's esophagus doesn't produce any symptoms. But if something is irritating your esophagus lining for a long time, you're likely to have symptoms from that. Chronic esophagitis -- inflammation in your esophagus -- may feel like heartburn or chest pain on the lower end, or like a sore throat if it's higher. It may make your esophagus feel swollen or cause difficulties swallowing. It takes years of chronic esophagitis to damage your esophagus tissues enough to trigger metaplasia. If you have any chronic symptoms, even if they're mild or they come and go, check in with a healthcare provider. Chronic acid reflux is the most common cause of esophagitis leading to Barrett's esophagus. If you ever feel or taste stomach juices backwashing into your esophagus after you eat, take notice.",
            "What causes Barrett\u2019s esophagus?": "Scientists don't completely understand why Barrett's esophagus occurs, but it seems to relate to chronic irritation or injury inside your esophagus. It may be a result of constant cellular repair. Most people who develop Barrett's esophagus have had gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) for at least 10 years. But not everyone fits this profile, and other irritants may also lead to Barrett's esophagus. The ways that Barrett's esophagus changes your esophagus lining suggest that it's trying to protect itself. Your esophagus lining normally has some protection from acids and other irritants, but not as much as your intestinal lining. Since acids and digestive enzymes do most of their work inside your small intestine, it needs extra protection. Intestinal metaplasia in your esophagus suggests that it does, too.",
            "What are the risk factors for getting Barrett\u2019s esophagus?": "You may be more likely to develop Barrett's esophagus if you: Were assigned male at birth (AMAB). People assigned male get it two to three times more often than people assigned female. Are older than 55. This condition takes time to develop. Have GERD. Between 10% and 15% of people with GERD get Barrett's esophagus. Smoke. Smoking may be a contributing factor."

            "How is Barrett\u2019s esophagus diagnosed?": "A gastroenterologist, a specialist in gastrointestinal diseases, usually diagnoses Barrett's esophagus. They'll look inside your esophagus for evidence of the tissue changes and take small tissue samples to confirm them (biopsies). They'll do this in a procedure called an endoscopy. This means putting a tiny camera on a long tube down your throat to examine your esophagus, while you're under sedation.",
            "What are the signs of Barrett\u2019s esophagus on examination?": "In general, normal esophageal lining is pale pink and smooth, while intestinal metaplasia is salmon-colored and coarse. But inflammation in your esophagus could obscure these features. Your provider might need to take multiple biopsy samples from different places to study under a microscope. This is how they'll confirm the structural changes in the cells of your esophagus lining (epithelium). Normal esophageal epithelium consists of stratified squamous cells. These are flat, square cells arranged in layers ('squamous' means flat, and 'stratified' means in layers). The lower part of your GI tract (your intestine) is lined with columnar epithelium. Columnar cells are rectangular and lay side-by-side in a single layer. If these appear in your esophagus, your provider will diagnose Barrett's esophagus.",
            "Classifying Barrett\u2019s esophagus": "Your provider might describe your condition as: Short-segment Barrett's esophagus. This means the affected area is less than 3 cm long. Long-segment Barrett's esophagus. This means the affected tissue is longer than 3 cm. They might define the stage as: Non-dysplastic metaplasia. This means there's no dysplasia yet and a low cancer risk. Metaplasia with low-grade dysplasia. This means there's some dysplasia and cancer risk. Metaplasia with high-grade dysplasia. This means there's significant dysplasia and cancer risk. Carcinoma. This means dysplasia has progressed to cancer.",
            "Other findings": "People with Barrett's esophagus may also have: Esophageal stricture. This means your esophagus has become narrower, often due to scarring. Peptic ulcers. These are open sores caused by stomach acid or enzymes."

            "Treating the cause": "Chronic acid reflux, the most common condition leading to Barrett's esophagus, is treatable. Healthcare providers usually recommend a combination of diet and lifestyle changes and acid-blocking medications. Medications called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are very effective in protecting your esophagus from acid reflux and helping the tissues heal. A minor procedure can also fix the underlying defect that causes it. Prescription medications to treat acid reflux include: Omeprazole. Lansoprazole. Pantoprazole. Rabeprazole. Esomeprazole. Dexlansoprazole.",
            "Surveillance": "You'll need to have periodic endoscopy exams to check on your metaplasia and see if it's progressing. Your provider will tell you how often you should have them, depending on whether you have any dysplasia yet (precancerous changes). Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia only needs to be examined every few years. Barrett's esophagus after dysplasia should be examined yearly.",
            "Treatments for dysplasia": "Dysplasia is the next stage of cellular changes in your tissues between metaplasia and cancer. If a pathologist confirms you have dysplasia, they'll characterize it as either low-grade or high-grade (mild or severe). Your provider may recommend treatment or more frequent surveillance for low-grade dysplasia. For high-grade dysplasia, they'll recommend treatment to remove the affected tissue. Procedures to treat dysplasia include: Ablation therapy. Ablation means using very high or low temperatures to eliminate the affected tissue. Your provider can freeze or burn off the layer of intestinal metaplasia with cold gas (cryotherapy), a thermal balloon, a laser or radiofrequency. These are endoscopic procedures, meaning your provider treats you through an endoscope during an endoscopy exam. Endoscopic mucosal resection. Endoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive surgery technique that allows an endoscopist to perform minor surgery through an endoscope. Mucosal resection simply means that surgeons cut out the affected tissue from your esophageal lining (the mucosa). This might be a second-line treatment if ablation therapy fails to prevent further dysplasia. Surgery (esophagectomy). Surgery might be necessary if you have extensive, high-grade dysplasia, carcinoma or other complications, like a severe esophageal stricture. A surgeon removes the affected portion of your esophagus, then rebuilds it using pieces from your GI tract."

Sometimes, a layer of metaplasia hides underneath a layer of new, normal tissue. Sometimes, the injury continues, and so the process of metaplasia continues. Because of this risk, your healthcare provider will probably recommend continued surveillance, just to be safe.",

Precancerous or cancerous changes will affect your life expectancy. But most people with Barrett's esophagus will never develop these changes. In general, your prognosis (outlook) is better the sooner you seek treatment. You can prevent and even remove cancerous changes if you catch them early enough. A note from Cleveland Clinic Barrett's esophagus by itself won't harm you. But it's an important sign of prior injury. It's also a mild warning of possible future harm. What it means is that you need to address the underlying cause of injury to your esophagus. The common causes of esophagitis are usually treatable, and treating them can greatly improve your quality of life. Consider it a bonus if you can also reduce your risk of cancer."
