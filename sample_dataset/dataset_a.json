            "What is AA amyloidosis?": "AA amyloidosis is one type of the rare disorder amyloidosis (pronounced \u201cam-uh-loy-doh-sis\u201d). Amyloidosis happens when proteins in your body lose their three-dimensional (3D) structure and become twisted clumps of misshapen fibrils (amyloid deposits) that gather on your organs and tissues.\n\nAA amyloidosis is also known as secondary amyloidosis or amyloid serum A protein. This amyloidosis type happens when you have high levels of inflammation in your body that boost the serum A protein levels in your bloodstream. You may have high serum A protein levels if you have a long-lasting infection or inflammatory disease. In a sense, AA amyloidosis is a serious complication of inflammatory diseases and conditions. Healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis by controlling the underlying disease or condition.",
            "How does AA amyloidosis affect my body?": "AA amyloidosis can damage several of your organs, including your kidneys (most common), liver, spleen, stomach and intestines. Rarely, AA amyloidosis damages your heart. AA amyloidosis may also affect the amount of protein in your pee and your cholesterol levels.\n\nAA amyloidosis can be a terminal illness if it isn\u2019t treated. You may develop AA amyloidosis if you have a chronic illness that causes inflammation. When healthcare providers treat the underlying condition, they\u2019re also treating AA amyloidosis.",
            "Who is affected by AA amyloidosis?": "Anyone who has a chronic inflammatory condition can develop AA amyloidosis."

            "What causes AA amyloidosis?": "AA amyloidosis is a type of amyloidosis. Healthcare providers call amyloidosis a \u201cprotein misfolding disorder.\u201d Your proteins are long molecules that form 3D structures. They\u2019re multitaskers that do everything from providing energy, balancing fluids and helping with immunity to providing structure, carrying material and regulating your body\u2019s processes.\n\nNormally, proteins leave your bloodstream once they finish their assigned tasks. In protein misfolding disorders, proteins take on abnormal shapes that can\u2019t be removed and your body can\u2019t use. In AA amyloidosis, the abnormal proteins clump together, making amyloid deposits or fibrils that collect in your organs.\n\nRecent studies have identified dozens of medical conditions that cause AA amyloidosis. Those conditions include certain blood cancers, bacterial infections from diseases like chronic ulcers to rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, or inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis. People may inherit conditions that cause AA amyloidosis, including periodic fever syndromes such as Familial Mediterranean Fever.",

AL amyloidosis and AA amyloidosis have similar symptoms, but AL amyloidosis is a more aggressive form of amyloidosis."

            "How do healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis?": "AA amyloidosis happens because you have a chronic inflammatory condition that caused abnormal proteins to gather in clumps on your organs. Healthcare providers treat AA amyloidosis by treating the underlying inflammatory condition. By treating the underlying condition, providers reduce the inflammation that caused AA amyloidosis. AA amyloidosis symptoms ease as inflammation levels drop.\n\nThey may also use medications that treat active AA amyloidosis. Providers and researchers are developing additional AA amyloidosis treatments that may clear amyloid fibrils from your bloodstream before the fibril can build on your organs. They\u2019re also developing lab-made antibodies to target and clear amyloid fibrils already lodged in organs."

Fortunately, healthcare providers can treat AA amyloidosis by treating the underlying condition. Many times, AA amyloidosis symptoms may seem like common problems you\u2019re used to managing as part of your specific inflammatory disease or condition. But like many serious illnesses, healthcare providers can do more to treat AA amyloidosis when they catch the condition in its early stages. Talk to your provider if you notice changes in your inflammatory disease or condition. They\u2019ll be glad to evaluate your symptoms and explain what they mean."

Mainly, they form between loops of your small intestine. They can also form between an organ and the wall of your abdominal cavity.\n\nYour abdominal cavity contains your:\n\nAdhesions occur when there\u2019s injury or inflammation in your abdomen. They can even form from normal handling during surgery. In fact, they\u2019re most common after abdominal surgery. As a natural part of healing, scar tissue forms that can cause tissues to stiffen and stick together (\u201cadhere\u201d).\n\nAbdominal adhesions are the most common consequence of having surgery on your abdomen. The majority of people develop adhesions after abdominal surgery. But most people don\u2019t need treatment unless they\u2019re experiencing symptoms.\n\nAdhesions are also the most common cause of a small bowel obstruction. A bowel obstruction is a medical emergency that involves complete or partial blockage in your intestines."

This can occur shortly after or even years after surgery and lead to a small bowel obstruction.\n\nWith obstruction, food, liquid, air and waste can\u2019t pass through your intestines. You may notice symptoms such as:\n\nGet to an emergency room (ER) immediately if you\u2019re experiencing symptoms of a small bowel obstruction. It can be life-threatening without emergency care.",
            "What causes abdominal adhesions?": "Abdominal adhesions form after your body repairs injured tissue inside your abdominal cavity. They\u2019re like internal scars. If an organ or tissue inside your abdominal cavity is damaged, your immune system triggers inflammation to heal the tissue. As part of the healing process, the damaged tissue forms scar tissue.\n\nUnlike the scars that form when you skin your knee, adhesions in your abdomen don\u2019t peel and fade as if they were never there. Instead, damaged surfaces can stick together.\n\nApproximately 75% of diagnosed adhesions form as a result of abdominal surgery.

Increasingly, surgeons choose laparoscopic surgery over open surgery for many abdominal procedures.\n\nYour surgeon may also place barriers between tissue surfaces during surgery to prevent scar tissue from causing them to stick together. These barriers come in solid, liquid, gel and spray forms that dissolve in your body. Still, even with barriers, scar tissue is an unavoidable part of the healing process.\n\nResearch is ongoing to locate solutions that can reduce scarring that leads to complications."
